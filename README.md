# Watersports Recreation and Equipment Center (WREC)
**Created By:** Jeremie Wallin

**Date Created:** February 3, 2019


## Summary
WREC was created as a project requirement for my Mobile Application Development course.  The purpose of this project was to learn how to use jQuery Mobile to build a mobile website.
 
### Website Structure: (Hierarchical Organizational Structure)
Navigational pages include: Tubes & Towables, Waterskis, Kneeboards, Wakeboards, Ropes & Handles, Barefooting Equipment, and Customer Feedback.  All of which would include product categories based on the brands available for sale. 

### Details:
The homepage displays each navigational page as listed above.  It also includeds a filter option to allow the user to pin point exactly what category they desire (Also included in each page).  The page includes a panel on the leftside of the header displaying promotional offers codes that are to be redeemed at checkout (Pushes page to the right vs overlapping the navigational buttons).  Each page has been equipped with a back button for the user to return to the previous page with ease.  

The Barefoot Equipment is setup with a form where the user can input their favorite wetsuits offered by WREC.  This page is different from the other pages because it uses a 3 column grid layout vs the unordered list.  The page uses local storage to capture the favorite items that the user inputs into the favorites field.  The page provides a clear and submit button for the user to either go forth with the list, or clear the existing list if they would like to resubmit a new list.

The Customer Feedback page provides a way for the customer to submit questions, feedback, and comments related to the items for sale.  This page also uses local storage to capture comments inputed by the user.

jQuery ThemeRoller was used to create the theme of the website.  You will notice that the color schemes are consistent throughout the page with the exception of the "Barefoot Equipment" and "Customer Feedback" pages.
