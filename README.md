## Summary
WREC was created as a project requirement for my Mobile Application Development Course.  The purpose of this project was to learn how to use jQuery Mobile to build a mobile website.

### Website Structure: (Hierarchical Organizational Structure)
Navigational pages include: Tubes & Towables, Waterskis, Kneeboards, Wakeboards, Ropes & Handles, Barefooting Equipment, and Customer Feedback.  All of which would include product categories based on the brands available for sale. 

### Details:
The homepage displays each navigational page as listed above.  It also includeds a filter option to allow the user to pin point exactly what category they desire.  The page includes a panel on the leftside of the header displaying promotional offers codes that are to be redeemed at checkout (Pushes page to the right vs overlapping the navigational buttons).
